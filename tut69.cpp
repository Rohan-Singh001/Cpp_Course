                            Limited time -> Resize
                                         -> Sort
                                         -> Search
    
    STL => Standard Template Library => We can use STL to save our time and work duration

    Library of what?
    STL is the library of Generic classes and functions

    Why use STL?

    STL is used because its a good idea not to Reinvent the wheel.

    -> Reuse : Well tested components => When we use STL then we will Reuse the well tested components

    -> Time Savings => We saving our time using STL
      
    Components of STL?

    Components is already built in C++ and we can use components add library in our code.

     1. Containers -> Stores data and many more Use template classes.
     2. Algorithm  -> Sorting, Searching and many more use template functions.
     3. Iterators  -> 1. Object points to an element in a container
                      2. Handled just like pointers
                      3. Connects Algorithm with Containers
