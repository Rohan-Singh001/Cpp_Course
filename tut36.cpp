    /*  Inheritance in C++  -  Overview

      (1) Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs
      (2) In C++ we can reuse a class and additional features to it 
      (3) Reusing class saves time and money
      (4) Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of devloping and debugging the same thing again.

    /*  What is Inheritance in C++

      (1) The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using Inheritance
      (2) We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inherititing from it
      (3) The existing class is called as the Base Class
      (4) The new class which is inherited is called as the Derived Class
      (5) Reusing classes saves time and money
      (6) There are different types of inheritance in C++

      (1) Single Inheritance

    //  (1) Single Inheritance in C++

    //  A derived class with only one Base Class


    //  (2) Multiple Inheritance in C++

    //  A derived class with more than one Base class


    //  (3) Hierarchical Inheritance in C++

    //  Several Derived Classes from a single base class


    //  (4) Multilevel Inheritance in C++

    //  Derivinga class from already derived class


    //  (5) Hybrid Inheritance in C++

    /*
      (i)  Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.
      (ii)  A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance.
      (iii)  However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
